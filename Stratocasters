The Fender Stratocaster is a model of electric guitar designed in 1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton, and Freddie Tavares. 

The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has manufactured the Stratocaster continuously from 1954 to the present. 
It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top "horn" shape for balance. 
Along with the Gibson Les Paul, it is one of the most often copied electric guitar shapes. "Stratocaster" and "Strat" are trademark terms belonging to Fender.

The Stratocaster is a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including country, rock, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, punk and heavy metal.

Design developments[edit]

The Fender Stratocaster was the first guitar to feature three pickups and a floating spring tension tremolo system, as well as being the first Fender with a contoured body.[3] The Stratocaster's sleek, contoured body shape (officially referred to by Fender as the "Comfort Contour Body"[4][5]) differed from the flat, slab-like design of the Telecaster. The Stratocaster's double cutaways allowed players easier access to higher positions on the neck.[6]
